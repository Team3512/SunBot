/**
 * This class allows you to check if a button was pressed or released without
 * having to wait in one spot of code until that happens.
 *
 * It is useful for situations in which you need to toggle a variable and just
 * checking for it with Joystick::GetRawButton(uint32_t) would cause it to
 * toggle
 * in every iteration of a loop.
 *
 * USAGE
 * 1) Call UpdateButtons() at beginning of loop to get new button statuses from
 *    the Driver Station
 * 2) Call PressedButton(), ReleasedButton(), or HeldButton() to poll for
 *    whether the button was pressed or released since last loop iteration
 *
 * None of these functions block.
